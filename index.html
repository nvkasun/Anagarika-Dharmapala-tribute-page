        <p>
          With the invasion of Ceylon, by three western powers, namely,
          Portuguese, the Dutch and the British, the lifestyle of Sri Lankans
          were changed drastically. Invaders imposed their religion, language,
          customs, dress, food and their culture on the peoples in the island.
          They adopted the divide and rule policy to gain supremacy in the
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1505 to 1815, these invaders used their authority to make this
          country a safe haven for their ideals to flourish. However, in certain
          ways, they failed to convince or convert the whole community of
          islanders to satisfy their wants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Native people fought with their limited resources from time to time to
          chase them away from the country. Until they were driven away, they
          used all strategies to destroy our cherished culture existed for more
          than 2,000 years. During the British rule, two uprisings took place in
          the country in 1818 and 1848. Uva uprising under the heroic leadership
          of Keppetipola and the Matale uprising under Gongalegoda Banda and
          Puran Appu made a great impact on the lives of people. Finally, the
          western powers left the island making an indelible mark on the
          political landscape of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people in coastal areas and middle class preferred to embrace
          Christianity and Christian names giving up their traditional names and
          the religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Hewavitharana was born to a rich, upper middle class family at a
          time like this. His father, H. Don Carolis was an accomplished
          furniture manufacturer, and the mother was Mallika, whose name was
          synonymous with a famous queen in Buddhist literature. As usual, David
          was sent to a missionary school for education. He grew up with the
          knowledge of history in the country. He lamented furiously over the
          cultural, religious and national decline and developed a firm
          determination to fight against the escalation of the foreign power in
          the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a new name with religious connotation; a name revered in
          Buddhist literature. He became known as Dharmapala. He pledged to be
          an Anagarika, one who doesn’t have a home. (Na Agaram Yassa So =
          Anagariko). Homeless-ness means to dedicate oneself in leading a
          celebate life, treading the noble eight-fold path of the Buddha.
        </p>
        <p>
          He advised others also to take native, Buddhist names and give up
          ‘Thuppahi’ (westernised) names. Thus, Uparis Silva became Piyadasa
          Sirisena, the famous novelist. George Pieris became Gunapala Piyasena
          (Malalasekera), the erudite Buddhist scholar of repute.
        </p>
        <p>
          People listened to his message and were determined to assign Sinhala
          names to their children, instead of alien names. Native names, such as
          Piyasena, Piyadasa, Weerasena, Dharmadasa, Kamalawathie, Manel etc.
          became popular among native people. It paved the way, for people to
          maintain their national and cultural identities as a result of his
          patriotic message. Today, it is heartening to note that Sinhala
          people, irrespective of their religious faiths have assigned
          themselves with Sinhala names. Anagarika Dharmapala should be credited
          for this enormous change brought to the Sri Lankan society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his tremendous contribution in the fields of sociology, culture
          and religion, he made a great impact on day to day lives of the
          people. During the Sinhala-Muslim riots in the country, he was in
          India, however, he spoke against the grave injustices done to the
          Sinhala-Buddhists by the British Governor, Charmers. The Governor,
          himself was ironically a Pali scholar, Anagarika Dharmapala’s
          contribution helped expedite bringing constitutional changes to the
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          His anti-imperialist message was later highly taken up by some
          politicians and they carried out their campaign in a different style
          with a different flavor to gain independence. Three past pupils of the
          premier Buddhist school, Ananda College, Dr. S.A. Wickramasinghe,
          Philip Gunawardene and Dr. N.M. Perera, fought with their tooth and
          nail against colonialism and imperialism. They not only campaigned,
          but also, educated the masses to make their motherland a free,
          sovereign and an independent nation. Their dream came true in 1972,
          under the premiership of late Mrs. Sirima R.D. Bandaranaike, making
          the country a Republic. She took the native name, Sri Lanka, instead
          of her alien name, Ceylon. Anagarika Dharmapala was one of the
          pioneers of this campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a teenager, David Hewavitharana was chosen by the Buddhist leaders
          to represent the Theravada Buddhism at the Parliament of world
          religions held in San Francisco in 1893. It was a wake up call for
          America, as the moral decline seen as a result of the civil war. It is
          believed, that his speech had been written by none other than the most
          venerable, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala, Principal, Vidyodaya Pirivena.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anagarika Dharmapala, in his prepared address at the conference,
          convinced the audience how it is important to follow the noble
          eight-fold path delivered by the Buddha, according to Buddhist
          Philosophy, Swamy, Vivekananda of India presented the Hindu Philosophy
          at the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anagarika Dharmapala received invitations from the audience to make
          more speeches on Buddhism at various places in the US and he
          delightfully accepted each and every invitation. His name has been
          recorded in gold as the first Theravada Buddhist to bring the message
          of peace of the Buddha to this hemisphere. He came back with honors to
          the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          He later started visiting villages all over the country, to wake up
          the Sinhala-Buddhist villagers and talked about the dangers of the
          spread of foreign culture. A teenager who was so eager to hear one of
          his speeches, walked for more than twelve miles in Tissamaharama, the
          deep down south of Sri Lanka to listen to this great speaker and was
          attracted to his ideals. With great difficulties, this young boy
          finished his education and became the colossus of journalism. He was
          none other than, D.B. Dhanapala, Principal, Journalist and the patriot
          par excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anagarika Dharmapala, called the spade a spade. He was against the
          consumption of liquor and advised people to avoid consumption. He also
          made speeches against the meat consumption and labelled those who
          consume meat as ‘Vasalaya’ (outcaste). He became the close associate
          of Col. Henry Steele Olcott, the Theosophist, who later founded the
          Buddhist Theosophical Society. The first Buddhist school, Ananda
          College was founded. Thereafter, the Buddhist Theosophical Society
          undertook establishing more Buddhist schools in the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anagarika Dharmapala concentrated in spreading Buddha Dhamma in the
          world. He founded the Maha Bodhi Society in New Delhi with branches in
          London and New York. He started his own newspaper – Sinhala Bauddhaya
          – and opened the eyes of the Buddhists. The establishment of the
          Buddhist Maha Vihara in London, UK, was the greatest event that took
          place in the twentieth century in the annals of Buddhist history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three Theravada Buddhist monks, Ven. Paravahera Vajiragnana, Dehigaspe
          Pagnasara, and Hegoda Nandasara were selected and despatched to the
          London Buddhist Maha Vihara. They had been trained as Dhammaduta
          Bhikkhus. Before they arrived in London, an Englishman, who later
          became a Bhikkhu by the name of Ananda Metteyya, had been spreading
          the word of peace of the Buddha in UK. Ven. Paravahera Vajiragnana
          Nayaka Maha Thera, who later became the Vice-Chancellor of Vidyodaya
          University, wrote his most illustrious book on Buddhist Meditation and
          received his Ph.D. from Cambridge University during his tenure at
          London Maha Vihara. If, not for Anagarika Dharmapala, Buddhist world
          would have missed reading this great work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This great man while earning his reputation as a whistle blower, also
          made enemies, who were unpatriotic, corrupt and westernised. They
          harboured grudges and petty jealousies against Anagarika Dharmapala.
          Anagarika Dharmapala left the island for India with a firm
          determination not to come back to the island. He was disappointed over
          the manner in which he was treated. He died at Mula Ghandhakuti
          Vihara, India, as a Bhikkhu, by the name of Devamitta.
